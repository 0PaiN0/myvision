change cursor modes name convention

Really like a light green / blue and white color theme

Toolkit button functionality for getting smaller with the screen should be done when we know all of the buttons

Escape button should close the settings popup and cancel the shape labeller modal

cancel the creation of a new polygon when clicked escape or delete
or move shapes button

highlight shapes to indicate that the user needs to click on them to start adding/removing points

check when editing label name on the bigger laptop and clicking paste (with vertical overflow present); does
it scroll to appropriate width (does not on the smaller laptop, had to check for vertical overflow in ML popup functionality)

Think about partitioning some of the ML prediction work as there is a memory leak with a lot of images

arrow keys should go down the dropdown options for a label

try trashcan icon for remove image label

delete keyboard button should remove shape

was not able to check ML generated label list overflow border chrome fix on smaller screens

popover for github links

I beliveve the reason why the bottom of new bounding boxes is not showing up correctly is because the maximum canvas height was changed

fix cursor move for chrome browser in Ubuntu

will have to highlight initial buttons to get users started

rename exports datasets to download datasets

add and remove points buttons popovers are not in the correct position

help button top right

remove shape button is still active after drawing a shape

Things to check on chrome browsers on other pcs:

shape labeller modal  horizontal and vertical overflow fake borders
label list dropdown horizontal and vertical overflow fake borders
machine learning generated labels horizontal and vertical overflow fake borders
make sure the dim effect is not choppy for slower pcs

UX:

Check to see if the upload images and remove image button are not too high up, causing the user to click remove image when
their actual intention is to remove a shape. To fix this, can potentially move the buttons lower by increasing their padding top
or highlight the image to be removed (in red) on remove image button hover (border or potentially overlay)

Decided not to have a continue to edit polygon button on the popup as it made it look vulgar and does is not a functionality that users
would really want from the get-go as the rest of the polygon edit tools would enable them to ammend their polygons post creation

Decided not to use image segmentation because it works on pixel bases, where each and every boundary is drawn by an array of pixels
However, can be achieved by generating an algorithm that will draw polygons based on the boundaries found on the pixels variable's value
on line 318, file called as segment-annotator.js.

The following repo does use fabricjs, but to only draw a line;

The nice to haves:

select multiple images or shapes to delete (via ctrl)

can update the image list thumbnails by taking screenshot from farbicjs canvas when something changes

the label should not track off the screen

polygon size reduction when zoomed in is a little bit off

I believe the bounding box drawing bottom edge is not working in horizontally narrow images going by the trend

control the darkness of the background

control the thickness of shape corner sizes

control the size of labels

change label colors

rebind keys

export custom settings

animations for image upload, new label create

should alert the user when unsaved changes before leaving (potentially too intrusive for new people)
