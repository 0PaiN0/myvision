The nice to haves:

highlight all of them differently to indicate that
they can all be potentially edited (when none are selected)
Make sure this is properly needed by doing tests
when finished adding points, return to editable

created code to return from the continuous drawing mode to default,
however this may not be required if there will not be an explicit button
for continuous drawing, thus it is all up to the UX

deselect continuous when added polygon or another shape and waiting to add another one

add is not a mode and should not light up

change cursor modes name convention
when finished creating polygon, have popup option to go back to editing

should alert the user when unsaved changes before leaving

polyfill for scrollIntoViewIfNeeded for all browsers (only chrome right now)

Decided not to use image segmentation because it works on pixel bases, where each and every boundary is drawn by an array of pixels
However, can be achieved by generating an algorithm that will draw polygons based on the boundaries found on the pixels variable's value
on line 318, file called as segment-annotator.js.

The following repo does use fabricjs, but to only draw a line;

when editing label and clicking scroll, should not close the editing process, however not able to fix it
as click event on the horizontal scroll identifies the target as the label list parent (required)

consider using pretrained models to auto-lab`el the images

Really like a light green / blue and white color theme


Toolkit button functionality for getting smaller with the screen should be done when we know all of the buttons

Escape button should close the settings popup and cancel the labeller popup

Things to check for optimal UX:
Should the switch images section be located at the top or bot of the screen:
    index.html
Should the canvas fill up the entire screen when displaying images:
    drawImagesOnCanvas.js
Should there be a hover dim effect on image thumbnails
    styles.css

should be able to select labels in add point mode

set labelling popup height relative to text or label option height

make sure to use the custom scrollIntoViewIfNeeded in the labelList instead of element.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded
which is currently present in many files as it is not supported by FireFox

can update the image list thumbnails by taking screenshot from farbicjs canvas when something changes

/* button states file
