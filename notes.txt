The nice to haves:

highlight all of them differently to indicate that
they can all be potentially edited (when none are selected)
Make sure this is properly needed by doing tests
when finished adding points, return to editable

change cursor modes name convention

should alert the user when unsaved changes before leaving

polyfill for scrollIntoViewIfNeeded for all browsers (only chrome right now)

Decided not to use image segmentation because it works on pixel bases, where each and every boundary is drawn by an array of pixels
However, can be achieved by generating an algorithm that will draw polygons based on the boundaries found on the pixels variable's value
on line 318, file called as segment-annotator.js.

The following repo does use fabricjs, but to only draw a line;

Decided not to have a continue to edit polygon button on the popup as it made it look vulgar and does is not a functionality that users
would really want from the get-go as the rest of the polygon edit tools would enable them to ammend their polygons post creation

when editing label and clicking scroll, should not close the editing process, however not able to fix it
as click event on the horizontal scroll identifies the target as the label list parent (required)

consider using pretrained models to auto-lab`el the images

Really like a light green / blue and white color theme


Toolkit button functionality for getting smaller with the screen should be done when we know all of the buttons

Escape button should close the settings popup and cancel the labeller popup

Things to check for optimal UX:
Should the switch images section be located at the top or bot of the screen:
    index.html
Should the canvas fill up the entire screen when displaying images:
    drawImagesOnCanvas.js
Should there be a hover dim effect on image thumbnails
    styles.css

set labelling popup height relative to text or label option height

make sure to use the custom scrollIntoViewIfNeeded in the labelList instead of element.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded
which is currently present in many files as it is not supported by FireFox

can update the image list thumbnails by taking screenshot from farbicjs canvas when something changes

/* button states file
 default button active
 draw polygon button active
 draw bounding box button active
 remove polygon points button active
 add polygon points button active
*/

cancel the creation of a new polygon when clicked escape or delete
or move shapes button

when creating new polygon, clicking add points should not do anything
when creating new polygon, choosing to delete points, then clicking to create new polygon again
should resume polygon drawing

the label should not track off the screen

when want to delete shape and not selected shape, upon clicking delete, a cursor should appear to delete (colour should change whether 
a shape has been selected or not)

delete button does not set to a default mode when in continuous mode

add points mode should not delete the currently being drawn polygon and should instead remain in that same mode

shapes should not be out of bounds for the image

delete images button

check XML and YOLOTXT formats

fix firefox support for checkbox popover

rename exportlabels to exportdatasets

rename uploadFile to uploadImage

move facadeWorkersUtils contents to a folder outside named utils

are you allowed spaces in annotations?
