The nice to haves:

highlight all of them differently to indicate that
they can all be potentially edited (when none are selected)
Make sure this is properly needed by doing tests
when finished adding points, return to editable

created code to return from the continuous drawing mode to default,
however this may not be required if there will not be an explicit button
for continuous drawing, thus it is all up to the UX

deselect continuous when added polygon or another shape and waiting to add another one

add is not a mode and should not light up

change cursor modes name convention
when finished creating polygon, have popup option to go back to editing
